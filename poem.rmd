## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Little Birds are dining  
Warily and well,  
Hid in mossy cell:  
Hid, I say, by waiters  
Gorgeous in their gaiters -  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
I have wished a bird would fly away,

The fault must partly have been in me.  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright â€”  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
